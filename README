This DoItYourself plugin should help you implement an "exclusive selection" feature.
ie:
1. You set a list of items
2. between each item there is an hidden section
3. When you unfold an initially hidden section, that makes the one appear and hide the one which was opened - if there was one

Label sections should have a class "selector" set on
Content section should have a class "exclusive" set on.
